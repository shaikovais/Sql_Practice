Case when 
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
Input Format

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

Sample Input

10 10 10
11 11 11
30 32 30

50 22 51
20 12 61
20 22 50
50 52 51
80 80 80

Sample Output

Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle
Explanation


A+B > C and A+C > B and B+C > A then
case when A=B and B=C then 'Equilateral'
when A=B OR A=C OR B=C then 'Isosceles'
else 'Scalene' end
Else 'Not a Triangle' END
