Use dense rank if the input has duplicates
=============
select min(start_date),max(end_date) from
(
select start_date,end_date, 
rank() over(order by start_date)  dr ,
end_date - rank() over(order by start_date)  group1 
from projects)
group by group1
order by count(group1) asc , min(start_date) asc
;
============



select min(day) as start_day
      ,max(day) as end_day
      ,count(distinct who) as sales_people
      ,count(*) as sales_count
      ,sum(dollars) as sales_amount
from (-- our dense rank grouping query
      select day, who, dollars
            ,dense_rank() over (order by day) as rn
            ,day-dense_rank() over (order by day) as grp
      from   mysales
     )
group by grp
order by 1
