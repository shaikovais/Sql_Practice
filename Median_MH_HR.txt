Oracle has a function for median .

The median of a finite list of numbers is the "middle" number, when those numbers are listed in order from smallest to greatest.

If the data set has an odd number of observations, the middle one is selected. For example, the following list of seven numbers,

1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
has the median of 6, which is the fourth value.

In general, for a set {\displaystyle x}x of {\displaystyle n}n elements, this can be written as:

{\displaystyle \mathrm {median} (x)=x_{(n+1)/2}}{\displaystyle \mathrm {median} (x)=x_{(n+1)/2}}
A set of an even number of observations has no distinct middle value and the median is usually defined to be the mean of the two middle values.[1][2] For example, the data set

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
has a median value of 4.5, that is {\displaystyle (4+5)/2}{\displaystyle (4+5)/2}
